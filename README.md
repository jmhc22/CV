A recent graduate from Makers Academy, I'm a full stack software developer combining strong technical knowledge and ample training in favoured coding practices with years of production/project management experience.
<br>

## BACKGROUND ##

Backed by 4 years in broadcast within production/project management roles, I was no stranger to the constantly changing environment of technology. I discovered my affinity to technology early on, progressively steering more of my assigned projects towards those with more technical demands. I often found problem solving with the dev teams the most fulfilling part of my role, which led me to take the leap and apply to an intensive coding bootcamp.

Studying at Makers has instilled in me many of the best coding practices. I am trained in and am a true advocate in agile development, test-driven development, object-oriented programming and pair programming. Makers also emphasises a focus on wellbeing providing invaluable workshops that further built upon my already strong teamwork abilities and empthathetic nature. 

I am looking to bring my user-focused approach, drive and dedication to a team who are also passionate abount good coding practices, display strong team dynamics and facilitate an expansive further learning environment by providing support and encouraging development.

## SKILLS ##
**Communication + Teamwork** <br>
Coming from a production/project management role, ensuring the smooth running and effective communication of the team was one of my main focuses. I often designed communication workflows and connected different departments, always working towards the bigger picture and for the greater good of the team. 

**Attention to Detail** <br>
This was an essential skill while planning all logistical, financial and technological aspects of a production, ensuring and reporting cost efficiency, building and managing a balanced team, and ensuring health and safety whilst on site. 

**Quick Study** <br>
Led a project to determine the full legal requirements that were necessary to comply with strict French Employment Laws when sending a large number of employees, freelancers and subcontractors to France for the 2018 Ryder Cup. Had to quickly become well versed in the full legal requirments, working closely with Sky’s Legal and Tax departments to develop an efficient process that would fully cover everyone attending the event and be easily repeated for future Sky events in France.

**Positive** <br>
I bring a positive energy and outlook to teams that I work with, even in high-stress situations I maintain clarity helping to pick the team up and drive towards solutions. I have resolved conflicts between team members and encouraged others who have lost confidence. 

**Adaptable** <br>
Managing diverse production crews ranging from 20 to 250 people in Europe and the United States meant that I had to be flexible in my approach to different members of the team. I also needed to have an in-depth knowledge of everyone’s roles and all resources available ready to step into a number of different positions in order to counter unexpected problems.

**Development Researcher at Hungry Bear Media (May 2015 - May 2016)** <br>

## INTERESTS ##
**Health and Fitness:** Dedicated gym-goer and runner who often takes part in organised charity events, successfully sticking to a strict fitness routine around a busy work schedule. 

**Food:** Foodie and avid home cook, my mixed european and asian background exposed me to a diverse range of cuisines from a youn age. I'm always keen to try out the latest food spots, cook something from a cuisine I haven't tried before or add something new to my ever-growing rack of herbs and spices.
