### PROFILE ###
A recent graduate of Makers Academy. 

Backed by 4 years in broadcast in production/project management roles. London. 

About my coding - and what I like. 

Recently completed Makers and my transformation in ability. 

What I am looking for and what I find important. Continuous learning. 


I really enjoy working as part of a team, finding the team project weeks at Makers being some of the most rewarding. 

Ensuring the smooth running of the team was my main focus. Connected many different departments. 

Apart from a genuine interest and enjoyment of coding, one of the other main reasons I changed to a career in tech was due to the fact that you will never run out of things to learn (having felt I’d gotten everything I could from my previous job). 

During Makers I have become confident with my code and processes and have found that I am willing to challenge the way something is done - just as I would want people to challenge the way I have done something, always open to being shown a new way. 

I am not sensitive when it comes to my code, I appreciate that even after Makers I am still at the beginning of my coding journey and would have so much to learn from the experience of the tech team at Farmdrop.
